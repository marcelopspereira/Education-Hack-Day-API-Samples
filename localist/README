Localist has an API that allows event content at various schools across the nation to be retrieved.

Full documentation is available at http://docs.localist.com under the heading: Localist API.

To get a valid API key, sign up on the Localist demo instance at http://localist.com/baltimore. From your Dashboard, go to your Settings page. You'll see a box on the right with your API key. You can then use that key to access Localist API methods.
