CloudMine API Examples
======================

CloudMine provides a set of APIs for command backend services to developers.  With CloudMine you can:

1. Store and retreive arbitrary data
2. Perform user management (enable your app with user accounts)
3. Run server-side code
4. And more... (see me for pre-release goodies)!
